# Task ID: 93
# Title: Implement Telemetry Testing Framework with Humorous Response Capability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 90, 77
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework for validating telemetry functionality across all TaskMaster components, including the ability to respond with jokes during test scenarios to verify response handling mechanisms.
# Details:
This task implements a robust testing framework for telemetry validation with the following components:

1. **Telemetry Test Suite Creation**:
   - Create `tests/telemetry/` directory structure with comprehensive test files
   - Implement unit tests for telemetry data capture, sanitization, and transmission
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end telemetry flow validation
   - Create mock telemetry endpoints to simulate external analytics services

2. **Joke Response Testing Module**:
   - Implement a test utility that can inject humorous responses during telemetry testing
   - Create a collection of programming-related jokes for test scenarios
   - Add response validation to ensure joke responses are properly handled by telemetry systems
   - Implement timing tests to verify joke responses don't interfere with telemetry performance

3. **Telemetry Data Validation**:
   - Create validators for telemetry payload structure and content
   - Implement tests for sensitive data redaction and encryption
   - Add verification for proper anonymization of user data
   - Test telemetry opt-out functionality and preference handling

4. **Performance and Reliability Testing**:
   - Implement load testing for telemetry submission under various conditions
   - Add network failure simulation and retry mechanism testing
   - Create tests for telemetry buffer management and data persistence
   - Validate telemetry doesn't impact core TaskMaster functionality

5. **Cross-Mode Testing**:
   - Test telemetry functionality in both BYOK and hosted gateway modes
   - Validate mode-specific telemetry data collection and routing
   - Ensure consistent telemetry behavior across different AI providers

6. **Test Utilities and Helpers**:
   - Create mock telemetry services for isolated testing
   - Implement test data generators for various telemetry scenarios
   - Add debugging utilities for telemetry troubleshooting
   - Create automated test reporting for telemetry coverage

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Test Validation**: Run all telemetry unit tests to verify individual component functionality, ensuring 100% pass rate for data capture, sanitization, and transmission modules.

2. **Integration Test Execution**: Execute end-to-end telemetry tests across all TaskMaster commands, validating that telemetry data is properly collected and transmitted without affecting command performance.

3. **Joke Response Verification**: Test the joke response mechanism by triggering test scenarios and verifying that humorous responses are delivered correctly while maintaining telemetry data integrity.

4. **Data Privacy Validation**: Verify that all sensitive data is properly redacted or encrypted in telemetry payloads, with no personally identifiable information exposed in test outputs.

5. **Performance Impact Assessment**: Run performance benchmarks comparing TaskMaster execution with and without telemetry enabled, ensuring minimal performance degradation (< 5% overhead).

6. **Network Failure Simulation**: Test telemetry behavior under various network conditions including timeouts, connection failures, and intermittent connectivity to validate retry mechanisms and data persistence.

7. **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Execute telemetry tests in both BYOK and hosted gateway modes, verifying consistent behavior and appropriate mode-specific data collection.

8. **Opt-out Functionality Testing**: Validate that telemetry opt-out preferences are properly respected and no data is collected or transmitted when users have opted out.

9. **Mock Service Integration**: Verify that mock telemetry endpoints properly simulate real analytics services and capture expected data formats and frequencies.

10. **Automated Test Coverage**: Ensure test suite achieves minimum 90% code coverage for all telemetry-related modules and generates comprehensive test reports.
