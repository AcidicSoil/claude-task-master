# Task ID: 92
# Title: Add Global Joke Flag to All CLI Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a global --joke flag that can be added to any command to include a programming-related joke with the command's output.
# Details:
Implement a global joke feature that enhances all CLI commands with optional humor. The implementation should:

1. **Global Flag Implementation**: Add a global --joke flag (with -j shorthand) to the Commander.js configuration in the CLI foundation that can be used with any command.

2. **Joke Service Module**: Create a new module (scripts/modules/joke-service.js) that:
   - Maintains a curated collection of programming, development, and tech-related jokes
   - Provides a getRandomJoke() function that returns a formatted joke
   - Includes categories like programming languages, debugging, project management, etc.
   - Ensures jokes are appropriate and professional

3. **Output Integration**: Modify the existing output formatting utilities to:
   - Check for the --joke flag in global options
   - Append a formatted joke section to command results when the flag is present
   - Maintain proper formatting and spacing between regular output and jokes
   - Ensure jokes don't interfere with JSON output mode (--json flag)

4. **Command Integration**: Update all existing commands to support the joke flag by:
   - Modifying output functions to check for the joke flag
   - Ensuring consistent joke placement across all command types
   - Maintaining backward compatibility with existing command behavior

5. **Configuration Options**: Add configuration support for:
   - Enabling/disabling joke categories
   - Custom joke collections via configuration files
   - Joke frequency settings for repeated command usage

The implementation should be non-intrusive, maintaining all existing functionality while adding this optional enhancement feature.

# Test Strategy:
Verify implementation through comprehensive testing:

1. **Flag Recognition Testing**: Test that the --joke and -j flags are properly recognized across all existing commands (list, add, update, move, plan, etc.)

2. **Output Format Testing**: 
   - Verify jokes appear correctly formatted after normal command output
   - Test that jokes don't appear when flag is not used
   - Confirm JSON output mode (--json) excludes jokes or formats them appropriately
   - Test joke formatting with various command output lengths and types

3. **Joke Content Testing**:
   - Verify jokes are appropriate and professional
   - Test that getRandomJoke() returns different jokes on multiple calls
   - Confirm joke categories are working correctly

4. **Integration Testing**: Test the joke flag with:
   - Simple commands (list, help)
   - Complex commands with multiple outputs (update, plan)
   - Error scenarios to ensure jokes don't appear with error messages
   - Combination with other global flags (--quiet, --debug, --json)

5. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the joke feature doesn't impact command execution speed or memory usage significantly

6. **Regression Testing**: Run existing test suite to confirm no existing functionality is broken by the joke feature implementation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update CLI foundation to support global flags [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the core CLI framework to recognize and handle global flags like --joke across all commands, ensuring proper flag parsing and propagation throughout the application.
### Details:
Implement global flag parsing mechanism, update command dispatcher to handle global flags, ensure flag inheritance across subcommands, and maintain backward compatibility with existing flag handling.

## 2. Develop the joke-service module with joke management and category support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated service module for managing jokes, including joke retrieval, categorization, and content management functionality.
### Details:
Build joke storage/retrieval system, implement category-based joke selection, create joke content validation, add support for custom joke sources, and ensure thread-safe operations.

## 3. Integrate joke output into existing output utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 92.1, 92.2
### Description: Modify output formatting utilities to seamlessly incorporate joke content without disrupting existing output formats, especially JSON output.
