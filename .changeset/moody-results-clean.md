Add comprehensive `research` MCP tool for AI-powered research queries

- **New MCP Tool**: `research` tool enables AI-powered research with project context
- **Context Integration**: Supports task IDs, file paths, custom context, and project tree
- **Fuzzy Task Discovery**: Automatically finds relevant tasks using semantic search
- **Token Management**: Detailed token counting and breakdown by context type
- **Multiple Detail Levels**: Support for low, medium, and high detail research responses
- **Telemetry Integration**: Full cost tracking and usage analytics
- **Direct Function**: `researchDirect` with comprehensive parameter validation
- **Silent Mode**: Prevents console output interference with MCP JSON responses
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper MCP response formatting

This completes subtasks 94.5 (Direct Function) and 94.6 (MCP Tool) for the research command implementation, providing a powerful research interface for integrated development environments like Cursor.
